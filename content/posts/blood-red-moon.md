As day goes away and passes twilight
The menace of darkness begins to loom
Hail mortals the queen of the night
Bow down, kneel, to the blood red moon

Scream your heart out but with arms and legs
Forgo any semblance of grace or poise
Possessed with the soul of a rhythmless buffoon
Dance away your woes under the blood red moon.

Witches and warlocks, hellspawn of yore
Rise from your crevices, hide no more
Cast up a midnight, vanquish the high noon
Behold the devouring darkness, of the blood red moon.

Bash the shackles of tomorrow, shatter the chains of yesterday
Rejoice in the tonight; Numb the worries, numb the pain
Escape your turtle shell, demolish your cocoon
Rewrite fate with a broken pencil, under the blood red moon

Fallen from grace, orphans of the divine
Prisoners of space, sentenced to time
Submit to pandemonium, rot and then bloom
Then crumble to mere ashes, for the blood red moon

Shed tears from your eyes, till your veins run dry
The world is not gentle, the world is not kind
It gives you one truth, an ultimatum to die
Sing while you can, our ballad's end is nigh
Night lasts but till dawn, it will be over all too soon
What is life but a sabbath under the blood red moon
