i lie here, alone, in a storm of your blessings\
alone, in a storm of your curses\
alone, in your lights and their shadows\
alone, in your boons and your banes\
alone, away from your loving touch\
alone, away from your loving voice\
alone, away from your eyes that see me\
alone, away from your ears that hear me\
and i have all i could ask for, but your love\
i pray, make me worthy of your love

take my blessings and my curses\
my eyes and my ears\
chisel my flesh from marble anew\
file my skin to your will\
rend my sinews away from bone\
and my bones to ash\
rend me in twain and pierce every organ within me\
make an altar in my heart from my ashen bones\
let every drop bleed through it for your sake\
so that my body may be worthy of your love 

place a soul less tainted in my flesh\
cut the demon in my brain that fights\
against the madness that makes me yours\
cull the reins that bind me to the ground\
against the heavens, against your love\
let me fall off your shoulder and wet the desert sands\
so that the lightness of my lack may be worthy of your love

bless me with your light\
curse me with your light\
sear me with your light\
slice me with your light\
fill my hollow heart\
fill my empty brain\
fill my yearning nerves\
fill my restless veins\
craft me in your image, in your light\
so that I may be worthy of your love
