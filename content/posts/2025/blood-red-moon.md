As day goes away and passes twilight  
The menace of darkness begins to loom  
Hail mortals the queen of the night  
Bow down, kneel, to the blood red moon  

Scream your heart out but with arms and legs  
Forgo any semblance of grace or poise  
Possessed with the soul of a rhythmless buffoon  
Dance away your woes under the blood red moon.  

Witches and warlocks, hellspawn of yore  
Rise from your crevices, hide no more  
Cast up a midnight, vanquish the high noon  
Behold the devouring darkness, of the blood red moon.  

Bash the shackles of tomorrow, shatter the chains of yesterday  
Rejoice in the tonight; Numb the worries, numb the pain  
Escape your turtle shell, demolish your cocoon  
Rewrite fate with a broken pencil, under the blood red moon  

Hark o mob of skeletons, of complacency-withered bone\
All vice and all taboo, exercise, enjoy, and condone\
Play an orchestra of dissonance, with no octave, chord, or tune\
An ode to the moral anarchy, of the blood red moon

Praise the bride dressed in crimson, with a brand new garment sewn\
Bless her eternal marriage, to her celestial throne\
The recurring nightly parade, tonight not white but maroon\
Solemnise the wedding vows, of the blood red moon

Let the desires in your heart, drive you out of control\
Show the slavery to your instincts, which is branded upon your soul\
Salvage the crypts of your memory, covered in glyphs and rune\
And process the film under the light, of the blood red moon.

Fallen from grace, orphans of the divine  
Prisoners of space, sentenced to time  
Submit to pandemonium, rot and then bloom  
Then crumble to mere ashes, for the blood red moon  

Shed tears from your eyes, till your veins run dry  
The world is not gentle, the world is not kind  
It gives you one truth, an ultimatum to die  
Sing while you can, our ballad's end is nigh  
Night lasts but till dawn, it will be over all too soon  
What is life but a sabbath under the blood red moon
