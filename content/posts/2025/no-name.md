to we who have no name\
who are only called by accident\
and only known by accident\
and only loved by accident\
but still with multitudes of meaningless nicknames\
for each facade of the soul\
but in our hearts a child who was never named\
only found dead in anonymity\
who will never be remembered\
and never be forgotten

to we who cannot speak\
who know all words and no sentences\
in the foreign languages of all countries\
and build unopenable dams in our throats\
leaving mountain lakes that seep in stagnation\
bearing spring water that will never be drunk\
and words that will never be heard

to we who cannot love\
for whom all love is violence\
and all love is the dethroning of a king\
and all love is the downfall of an angel\
and all love is shameful lechery\
for whom there is no one to be loved\
those who rank last place in the race\
with unseeable starting lines\
and goalposts drowned in fireworks

to we who cannot sing\
for whom song is neighbour of the ear\
and alien of the mouth\
listeners of all the great stories\
of worlds we will never live in\
the great heros we will never be\
we who do deserve neither the great rise\
nor the greater fall\
nor the growth of a sapling\
nor the blossoming of its body and soul\
for we are stillborn seeds in this desert world

to we who cannot see\
for even the brightest flowers are too ugly\
for we never let the light into our eyes\
for we are born with bodies that our eyes reject\
for we are born with eyes that our bodies reject\
we the great vampirers and slumberers\
who spew darkness from our jaws\
and blind ourselves with our words

to we who cannot walk\
but in each story and song, fly to the heavens\
and in heaven eat breads of cloud and wine of light\
and meet invisible gods and inaudible angels\
and souls of only those we never knew\
and shake intangible hands as we part\
and in our sleep we return\
to our island and mountain prisons

to we who cannot live\
to we who are not allowed to live\
to we for whom life is forbidden\
to we who only see life in dreams\
and then sleep to see its nightmares\
and cry with silent hermit tears\
and nevertheless, we fear death\
and nevertheless, we stay alive
