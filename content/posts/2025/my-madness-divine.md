I stand steadfast in the eye of the storm\
From this deluge I am not swayed\
I work unirked from break of dawn\
Sharpening my finest blade

Purer than the liquid gold\
finer than the ripest wine\
sacred more than wedding vows\
so true is my madness divine

in delirium, ad infinitum,\
yet I am enlightened son\
only in my greatest loss\
this purest rage, i have won

I rain deluge with tears of mine\
and bring upon the strongest storm\
I am a landslide of emotion\
The eruption of Olympus Mons

Set fire to the ground, then fire to the air\
then drown the seas in blazing flares\
climb a staircase of burning gases\
and burn the sun up into ashes
