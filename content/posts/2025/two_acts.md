### PROLOGUE

##### OUTSIDE THE TRAIN

_two crows perch on a train. a noisy crowd walks across the street below. puddles reflect the rays of a just risen sun. the noise of electricity blares, itself outdone by the rocking of the train. muffled chatter is heard from inside the train._

STOUT CROW: the city lives.

SLENDER CROW: miserably, it lives.

ST.: but it lives.

SL.: somehow, it lives.

ST.: the sun rises.

SL.: miserably, it rises.

ST.: bringing joy and light.

SL.: miserable joy and light.

ST.: how could light be miserable?

SL.: it beckons you to work.

ST.: but what of us?

SL.: we too must work.

ST.: but what of the princesses who sleep to noon?

SL.: they sleep in curtained beds and masks over their eyes.

ST.: is there sun enough for them?

SL.: there is not.

ST.: how miserable.

##### INSIDE THE TRAIN

THE BOY: do you have a spare charger? my phone is out of juice.

THE MAN: i do, but there is no outlet to charge here.

THE BOY: i will give it back the next time i see you.

THE MAN: i don't trust you to give it back.

THE BOY: you look too rich to care either way.

MAN: one should strive to be too rich to care either way.

BOY: why so?

MAN: oh so many things. you can work in air conditioned offices while the masses toil in the heat. tell me, are you studying to become an AI scientist?

BOY: no, i would like to be a poet.

MAN: what a waste! one should strive to become an AI scientist.

BOY: why so?

MAN: it pays well. did you know that every hotel has a special room for AI scientists? and in that room the floors and ceilings are all tiled in gold?

BOY: even the toilets?

MAN: even the toilets! not only that, all toilets are chauffeured by servants dressed in gold.

BOY: i would still rather be a poet.

MAN: why so?

BOY: for love.

MAN: all love is farce. a meaningless facade.

_a moment of awkward silence befalls the two of them_

MAN: here, don't bother to return it.

_hands him the charger_

BOY: thanks.

##### BACK OUTSIDE THE TRAIN
  
ST.: is hell the greatest punishment?

SL.: only for the dead.

ST.: and for the living?

SL.: the fate of Midas.

ST.: the fate of Midas?

SL.: to have your wish, only to become a monster.

ST.: is a man with golden touch a monster? 

SL.: and as much a monster he was when he made the wish.

ST.: how miserable.

### ACT 1

#### Scene 1
  
##### INSIDE THE CLASSROOM
  
_a classroom with kids chattering among each other. the last class of the school year has just ended. partially smudged writings on the blackboard indicate that a masquerade event is to happen the next day._

BOY: what will you wear for the masquerade?

FRIEND: a tiger mask!

BOY: that's dumb. a tiger?

FRIEND: yes, like El Roido?

BOY: El Roido?

FRIEND: yeah, he's a wrestling guy.

_FRIEND scrolls on his mobile to find an interesting clip of El Roido._

BOY: what would a good romantic mask look like?

_FRIEND stops scrolling._

FRIEND: a romantic mask? for-

BOY: yes.

FRIEND: i don't know what you're thinking.

BOY: what mask would a lover wear?

FRIEND: no mask, surely.

BOY: but you can't go to a masquerade with no mask.

FRIEND (after a pause, pointing to another boy in the class): unless you're him!

_they chuckle._

FRIEND: i still don't get, like, the _criteria_ for a romantic mask.

BOY: a mask worthy of love.

FRIEND: is there a mask worthy of love?

##### OUTSIDE THE CLASSROOM

_two crows perch on a wire, looking intently into the classroom from a window._

ST.: is there a mask worthy of love?

SL.: there are many masks that can be loved.

ST.: but will they make the bearer worthy of love?

SL.: who can love a man behind a mask?

ST.: can someone love a man behind a mask?

SL.: they cannot.

ST.: then what is love anyway?

SL.: that is the question.

#### Scene 2
  
##### INSIDE THE OFFICE
  
_a meeting room inside an office. the walls are made of glass facades, covered by white curtains on the inside. the light inside is blindingly white. some 12 chairs are haphazardly laid out, half are filled. a slideshow is being presented on the screen. _

THE MAN: but what _is_ an AI curtain?

THE MANAGER: it is a curtain with artificial intelligence.

MAN: what does that mean?

MNG.: the curtain is smart.

MAN: how so?

MNG.: it opens as the sun rises!

MAN: but no one wakes up when the sun rises.

MNG.: do you not wake up when the sun rises?

MAN: i only do at this time of the year.

MNG.: one should strive to be like their ancestors on every day of the year.

MAN: preach.

MNG.: i hope you have the design prepared.

MAN: i do.

MNG.: please present then.

MAN: the curtain has a vigour sensor imbibed on the top, which amplifies the first light of dawn using a mirror matrix-

EXECUTIVE: and how much will this mirror matrix cost us?

MAN: we have consulted our vendors to provide us mirror matrices for an exceptionally cheap cost.

EXECUTIVE: i see, please proceed.

MAN: the light, reflected through the mirror matrices will generate an amplified current, that uses our patented cervical motors to gently open the curtain-

MNG.: with bicubic intensity i presume?

MAN: with bicubic intensity, as we discussed.

COWORKER: and what if there is an eclipse?

MAN: we have planned for all contingencies, there will be no more eclipses at dawn until 2036.

CWK.: but what if it is cloudy?

_MAN turns pale, stutters, and looks toward MNG._

MNG.: this is a problem.

EXC.: a big problem.

MAN: do we have AI that can look beyond the clouds?

EXC.: we will have one in the next fiscal quarter.

MAN: can we delay the launch until then?

EXC.: we cannot. our clients are our utmost priority.

MNG.: then we should use an oracle.

MAN: do we have AI that can consult an oracle?

MNG.: we do, but we will need permission to provision an oracle. i will get it arranged.

EXC.: good thinking. let's discuss this in our next meeting.

##### OUTSIDE THE OFFICE

ST.: what does man do behind glass facades?

SL.: he tames the oracles.

ST.: do the oracles wish to be tamed?

SL.: they do not particularly care.

ST.: does man wish to tame the oracles?

SL.: he does not particularly care.

ST.: then why does it need to be done behind curtains?

SL.: the sun is overwhelmingly bright.

ST.: too bright for the oracles?

SL.: too bright for man.

### ACT 2

#### Scene 1
  
##### A DARK COLD PLACE
  
_inside a dark cold room underground. the loud whirring of fans can be heard. racks are compartmented horizontally and vertically into a shelf with about a hundred cells. each cell is veiled with thin translucent sliding doors, that have inlets and sockets that wires can be plugged into. haphazard tangled wires of various colours are spread across the floor. faint childlike silhouettes sleeping in a foetal position can be seen. gentle humming sounds, half-human and half-machine can be heard from inside the cells._

CARETAKER: the oracle is asleep.

MAN: may i disturb it?

CARETAKER: why?

MAN: to connect it to the AI curtain network, as i'm sure you have been informed.

CARETAKER: can i see your ID?

_THE MAN provides his identity card. CARETAKER looks at it for a moment, then at THE MAN's face, then at the card again. he returns the card.

CARETAKER: alright. be careful not to awaken it.

_THE MAN carefully inserts various plugs of different shapes and sizes into different inlets. he pauses for a second before connecting the last one, and shifts his gaze towards a panel besides the cell while inserting it. the panel shows various shifting charts, numbers, and gauges. it is unclear what can be inferred from these, but THE MAN seems cautiously satisfied looking at them._

CARETAKER: is it done?

MAN: it seems so. but we'll only know when the sun rises tomorrow.

CARETAKER: and until then?

MAN (pointing to a purple cable): it doesn't really matter. the oracle's opinions are piped into the aether until the night is almost over.

CARETAKER: to prevent mistakes? you're wasting useful dreams.

MAN: i'm not paid to conserve dreams.

CARETAKER: empty dreams are risky business. what if it short-circuits?

MAN: that's what the cache regressor is for.

_CARETAKER and THE MAN both give another look at the circuitry, then at the figure within. the inhabitant is quiet and motionless. the observers look cautious._

CARETAKER: if you say so.

MAN: let me check inside anyway.

_THE MAN reaches for the door and tries to peek inside. CARETAKER shrieks and tackles THE MAN. the sound of nails tearing through fabric and grinding on metal are heard simultaneously. a soft scream is heard from within._ 

_the scream grows louder. shallow screeching emanates from neighbouring cells. the sound is shrill like a child's, yet metallic. panels flicker intensely, with no obvious message but an indication that something has gone terribly wrong._

_the two men sit aghast. they speak something but their voice is drowned out by the cries._

_CARETAKER staggers towards a control panel near the entrance of the room. the cries are now deafeningly loud, heard equally intensely from every cell._

_CARETAKER presses areas of a screen in a cryptic sequence. the crying oracles fall silent. the room gets quieter progressively._

_the oracles fall silent. heavy breathing of CARETAKER and THE MAN are now audible. they are both coming to tears, staring at each other. CARETAKER's hand is still stuck to the panel, and THE MAN sits on his knees, dazed._

_a minute passes by. not a word is spoken._

##### OUTSIDE THE OFFICE
  
_SLENDER CROW is perched on a wire. it gazes at the office building for a few seconds, then flies away._

#### Scene 2
  
##### ABOVE THE FIELD
  
_bright lights beam into the sky from the school grounds. boys and girls dressed in fancy garbs walk across the field. all of them are wearing masks of one kind or another. banners and decorations are strewn. soft music is playing. a large curtained tent is set up in the middle of the field. the inside is barely visible but numerous human silhouettes can be made out._

ST.: is it time yet? i am tired.

SL.: tired? but it is only dusk.

ST.: i was awake all day.

SL.: out of pity?

ST.: no. this cruelty is so needless.

SL.: out of pity, i see.

ST.: oh to be a raven, or a sparrow.

SL.: oh to be a coward.

ST.: i'm no coward.

SL.: yes you are. regardless, i must be on my way.

_SLENDER CROW flies away_

##### ON THE FIELD
  
BOY (wearing the mask of a king): this is my last chance.

FRIEND (wearing the mask of a tiger): your last chance to confess?

BOY: yes.

FRIEND: but she will be gone tomorrow!

BOY: i must do it anyway.

FRIEND: oh but you should have been here for the dance.

BOY: was she among the dancers?

FRIEND: if only you were there to see it. 

BOY: where is she now?

FRIEND: she's resting in the tent with the others. their act is over now.

BOY: i must go to the tent then.

_he flips past the curtains to enter the tent._

ST. (above): _sigh_

##### INSIDE THE TENT
  
_five women lay sleeping on beds, on their back, motionless. their arms are besides their torso, straight. they are all wearing the same mask, of a peacock_

BOY: oh for love, my love! it is time for us-

_he gazes upon the resting women_

BOY (aside): a challenge! love's kiss shall awaken my true love, but i must recognise correctly.

_he gazes upon their faces_

BOY (aside): oh but it is all the same mask.

_he looks at their arms and legs_

BOY (aside): and no necklace, or bracelet, or anklet to tell them apart.

_he investigates again_

BOY (aside): i can tell them apart, and one of them is my chosen one.

_he checks for their hair, but they're all tucked behind the head_

BOY (aside): and yet,

_he looks at them longer_

BOY (aside, desperate): but if i close my eyes, _fate_ and _love_ will guide me.

_he shuts his eyes for a few moments, then looks at them again_

BOY (aside, panting): no, no, no

_he looks at them again, still dumbfounded that he can't tell them apart._

_he rushes towards the curtains, yelling in anguish_

_he tries to unfurl the curtains, but they stay shut_

BOY (screaming): HELP, HELP

_he looks back at the girls. they are fast asleep in spite of his yelling and anguish._

BOY (screaming): SOMEONE HELP

_commotion ensures outside. someone tries to slice the curtains, but to no avail. and then, fire. erupts. the boy rushes out of the tent in agony, and looks back at the girls in the tent. they are still fast asleep. various adults hurry around the area to control the disaster with varying degrees of success. after a while, the fire subsides in an instant. six masks are left among the ashes of the tent. five peacocks and a king._

ST.: i wish it were not so.
