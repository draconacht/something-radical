i assure you this isn't (just) traumadumping.

### prelude

growing up, i didn't like sports or athletic activities of most kind. it's not like i was opposed to the idea altogether, but i think i sour-grapes-ed into it from not being athletic to begin with and spiraled down from there. the less well you can perform, the less people want you on your team. the teachers i had growing up weren't trained in dealing with the runts of the pack, but in helping the best win in competitions and what not. consequently, i spent sports classes sitting on the sidelines with the other kids who were also below the required minimum of physical activity for reasons i am unaware of and apathetic to. i'm sure there's many other positive feedback loops in schooling and society, and i also happen to be the benefactor of many of them, so i'm still living a quite comfortable life. 

there are some culprits to blame here. i grew up with an apathy towards the idea of fitness (for many complex reasons), in a household with pitiful protein consumption. i was never at the point where an actual physical disability diagnosis was to be considered, but still struggled with anything physically strenuous. normally the normal teenager gets coaxed into physical activity for the purpose of competition (which i would see enough of academically) or to achieve a certain body image to attract a crush and or partner (i will not explain). entering late teenage / early adulthood, i was isolated from larger society for a variety of reasons (competitive exams, phones, people moving out / away, the pandemic), leading to a deterioration that peaked around the time i entered college.

after a few actual medical diagnoses, dietary supplements, an _incredibly_ slow exercise regime, and physical activity borne from the needs of post-pandemic adult life -- i can actually walk places, climb stairs, hold the laundry, and cook without much discomfort. none of it was easy, but the challenge was never the pain of the exercise. the impact of exercise is slow, and when one part of your body becomes capable of bearing load, you realise there is another that was just a bit short of overstressed so far. it feels fruitless in the instant, taking weeks if not months to feel perceptible change.
### categories of exercise

there are many ways in which one can exercise so as to achieve various outcomes. you can strength train to train strength, and you can do cardio to train your cardiovascular system for better stamina or whatever. but where do you put exercise that exists _to make the pain stop_. what name do you give to exercise so that you can actually climb stairs and don't feel like shit after cooking something? i don't know the name for such a thing but that's neither here nor there.

i don't like the culture around fitness. this should go without saying as i am one of the discontents of fitness. it is fallacious and egocentric to find the unattainable grapes sour, but i still do. gyms were largely out of the question for me, and i've heard of people having personal trainers or extended physiotherapists to plan out their regiments with, that was entirely alien to me. i stopped trying to exercise for the sake of lofty body image goals because that has always felt (and perhaps been) unattainable. i can imagine that something like that is possible, but it's not on my mind for the time being. more on that later.

yoga happens to be a category of exercise. for the rest of this writeup i'm not going to speak of the platonic ideal of yoga (i.e. i read it in X book from Y author and here's the canonical source) but on the way in which it is perceived and perpetuated. yoga involves performing certain poses, breathing exercises, meditation sitting still, and fancy finger movements that ostensibly do something. what then, is the selling point of yoga? is it strength, weight loss, flexibility, peace, or something else?
### why i dislike(d) yoga

[the UN's page on International Yoga Day](https://www.un.org/en/observances/yoga-day) is filled with many comforting unfalsifiable platitudes on the merits of yoga. one would have a hard time deciding how statements like `This mindfulness allows one to choose healthier and more sustainable lifestyles` play out. buying a PVC yoga mat hardly contributes to the sustainability of anything whatsoever. scrolling down, it quotes Narendra Modi:

```
Yoga is an invaluable gift from our ancient tradition. Yoga embodies
unity of mind and body, thought and action ... a holistic approach
[that] is valuable to our health and our well-being. Yoga is not just
about exercise; it is a way to discover the sense of oneness with
yourself, the world and the nature.
```

i do not like mysticism. i do not like pinning the benefit of exercise in abstract goals of unities and onenesses and things like that. i am in some senses a person of science. i wake up one day being able to lift only five kilograms of weight, and wish to wake up some time in the future being able to lift ten. this necessitates the growth of certain muscles. muscles are not built out of airs and unities, but out of proteins and extensions and contractions. for this reason, i have found yoga to be uninteresting and mostly meaningless growing up.

i associate yoga with contortionists and gurus capable of other mystical feats. i associate it with teachers telling me to breathe in and out many times, and stare at a wall and say Om. i associate it with fictional women in developed nations who for whatever reason take an oriental liking to the idea of doing exercises that they cannot pronounce in a garden as a group. i associate it with older people telling me i could fix my problems by walking a lot, drinking the right amount of water, and breathing correctly (whatever that implies). i do not like these associations, and growing up a cynical contrarian teenager i'm not surprised these associations drove me away from the idea.

### thinking from scratch

i don't exercise with any equipment. largely because i don't have the strength to use specialised tools for strength training, but also probably because of some inertia and stagnation. the exercises i do are either bodyweight-based or simple stretches, or i bring some makeshift equipment like a towel for posture or a water bottle for weight. 

over the years, i've consulted a handful of friends, physiotherapists, relatives, and online guides on the exercises that would be suitable for my health and capacities at the time. at some point of time i bought a yoga mat, as my bed wasn't large enough for exercise and especially unfit for something like (knee) push-ups. recently it has occurred to me that many of the exercises that have been a part of my routine (cat-cow stretches, dead bug, etc.) have yoga equivalents. 

### on a winter morning like this

the north indian winter can be quite brutal at times. the temperature itself isn't that cold, and consequently there isn't any real infrastructure for heating. winterwear options are woefully limited, rooms don't come with heat pumps, plumbing isn't insulated, and so on. waking up before noon is a tough task, the air is cold and the bed is warm. these are the few months of the year when sunlight brings comfort instead of pain, and you can open the window without having your room infiltrated by death-bringing mosquitoes (though there still are the relatively harmless flies). 

i've started exercising in the morning nowadays, on the balcony on holidays and weekends. the sunlight, blue skies (only occasionally, sadly), ambient sounds of passers-by, and the relative silence from lack of air conditioning make it a delightfully peaceful experience. it's even better on holidays, because i don't have to hurry to go to work or worry about other things like that. and as it's far from my bed i have my phone away from hand as well. sometimes i pause during exercise to lay down, take in my surroundings and just think about things. that's as close to meditation as i get.

this is a very different script for exercise. there are many script for exercise that i have been told and seen over the years. you can do it in the gym, with music or a podcast. you can do it in a public place, with a group or an instructor. you can do it in a swimming pool, or an outdoor gym. exercise is associated with pushing yourself, pumping iron, sweating, and generally moving around. these things can be great, of course, but it's not the only shape in which exercise has to be done. pushing and pulling the right muscles can very well be done in a calmer setting. is this the essence of yoga?

### the hell do i know

is my exercise routine a "oneness with myself, the world, and nature"? regrettably and undoubtedly so. but nature is not just grass and trees. everything created by man is just as much "nature". the chatter of people on the street, the flowing of water, the animal noises, the blue sky, the dazzling sun. it's a pleasant feeling, and it's a different feeling from going outside. the purposelessness of it makes it an activity of leisure. an activity where you can pause and reflect. you don't have to think about cars passing by, cigarette smoke, or the need to get somewhere in the next half an hour.

i don't care if what i'm doing is yoga or not. i continue to not like the idea of yoga and am still opposed to many of the symbolisms brought about in explaining it, however secularised they are. i approach exercise with the goal of increasing my capacities as a physical person. i want to be able to move my body around more and better, and do things that i need to in my day to day life without pain. i didn't choose my way of doing exercise because i _want_ to meditate while exercising or that i think the solitude is divine or something. i came unto it by accident, and i like the spot where i've landed. 

### randomass closing thoughts

insects are annoying. one would have to imagine people were always annoyed by them. i wonder if people used to use incense while exercising outdoors. 

the sun feels good when it's colder. i wonder if global warming has changed how we feel about exercising in the open. also the pollution thing.

i like having my cake and eating it too. it's fun to think about ideas you dislike after you detach them from the connotations derived from what normies like to say about them. sturgeon's law etc.
