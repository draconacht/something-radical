for three months a year, a dense haze descends over delhi. this fog brings inconveniences of course, but it also brings disease and infirmity. it also brings opportunity for prospecting sellers of air purifiers, electric cars, and cold medicine. and last of all, it brings complainers.

there isn't anything wrong about complaining. being in dismay at a dismal state of affairs is reasonable. it's one of the few things that brings the otherwise-inert cattle class to protest on the streets, asking for a solution to what everyone assesses correctly as a public health crisis. judges make remarks, lawmakers pass policies, and every year after Diwali a thousand fireworks are blown and the smell of sulphur signals the arrival of the same damn curse again. and again it comes with the same intensity, and again it brings the same disease. and again there are protests, and again the question is raised. if the whole theater of government exists for the public good, why is it taking them so long to make the air breathable?

the malaise i want to write about is not the air or the disease that it brings. i'm frustrated at the culture i see around public health and the way we as a society choose to approach it. the malaise is the uneasiness, the hopelessness of trying the same tactics each year and witnessing things be exactly the same as they were. the malaise is the way we create isolating safety bubbles that further alienate us from the already-barely-walkable climate of urban delhi.

### the causes of this condition

i don't think there is an authoritative answer as to what causes the air pollution each winter in delhi. stubble burning and automobile emissions are blamed, allegedly exacerbated by delhi's being landlocked and having stagnant winds. industrial runoffs and landfills are also put to blame.

but then, there is a higher why we can ask. why would you have landfills in the middle of a city? why do farmers burn stubble? why do we depend on cars as much as we do? why does construction have to as dust generating as it is? and if we are to be more brave, why can we not do anything about the winds? climate engineering may not be that mature of a science, but it doesn't hurt to ask regardless.

and then we can ask why-nots. why does the same situation not arise in the summers? why not in the many other cities of the country? why not in other industrialised countries (of course, similar levels of pollution are measured in Hanoi and certain parts of China, and from a cursory glance at a map also Pakistan and Qatar at the time i'm writing this)? 

and once we answered these whys and why-nots we can ask even broader societal whys and why-nots. what about our modes of government and statecraft force us into situations like this? why do we have key industrial, commercial and cultural centers in places that are so frequently uninhabitable? why do we as a society address this with solutions that work for wealthy private-desk-job citizens instead of solutions that also address the lives of labourers, farmers, students, and gig workers? asking questions like this is the job of good philosophy, and answering them the job of a myriad other disciplines who we some way or another exclude from these discussions. fixing them is the issue of politics and statecraft, which is obsessed with apoliticality and political correctness (curiously simultaneously, in the indian context one can only be politically correct by demonstrating their apolitical nature).

### but this rambling is actually about something else

that last sentence that i smuggled in there is a lie. fixing public health issues is not just the responsibility of politics and statecraft. fixing issues in society is also a problem for engineers and entrepreneurs, scientists and economists. but in the middle of a protest and in the middle of a twitter thread you do not see someone go -- "aha! _i_ have a solution! we with our ambitious new startup plan to use science and technology to fix these problems". why this is the case is beyond me, but one would imagine an enterprising organisation would have no issue reaching a mass audience or building rapport with the relevant ministries in times of crisis. likewise aspiring scientists should not (though perhaps they do) have difficulty finding funding to research solutions for air pollution. every corporation in the NCR would gladly use their CSR funds towards fixing this, if only to protect the value of their land. individual activists, hell even vigilantes could make a name for themselves if they achieved substantial change. and yet, when someone comes to complain about the state of the climate - the script involves none of these actors. it goes - 

### the profanity of taxation

"in spite of paying 30% of our income in taxes, the government cannot provide us clean air or water in return". taxation is of course a messy concept, and the "taxation is theft" claims have existed on either side of the political spectrum. we could do a lengthy audit on the effectiveness and efficiency of tax collection and spending. we would presumably find very many inefficiencies and cases of corruption in this process. but i don't think either of those explain the persistent vitriol thrown towards the _concept_ of taxation.

when any kind of malpractice or catastrophe is observed in the public sphere, whether it's infrastructure, transport, safety, or public health, it is immediately alleged that the government is responsible. the blame is typically pinned on the chief / prime ministers, and calls are made for their resignation. cushy white collar employees take to social media to complain about the state of the state, the ineffectiveness of the government, and their desire to move to UAE. the only speaker more reprehensible in this conversation is the one who has already moved to UAE and is thus participating in this conversation for reasons beyond me. 

there is however, a long chain of events between collection of taxes, the government man doing whatever a government does, and catastrophe. in between are the aforementioned businesses and engineers, scientists and policymakers. money passes through many hands before it becomes a mediocrity-plagued object in material reality. it passes through systems of governance, regulation, oversight, allocation, discretion, organisation, budgeting, research, and design among many other things. any or multiple of these steps falling short can cause failure of public projects. and yet in the public eye, blame is stopped at the government and so is the responsibility for any correction.

for all the people worried about identity leaks from Aadhaar, how many say "what role could i play to fix this?" of course, many would not be qualified to answer that question. many others would prefer to sip Starbucks coffee on their comfy desk job building B2B SaaS softwares for other corporations which also build software for other corporations which so on and so on. i'm sure the world of engineering for the greater good is dirty and slimy in many ways, but it's better to try and fail than to have not tried at all.

or just sell land to get the Dubai golden visa and put that on your linkedin profile like the other ghouls or something.
