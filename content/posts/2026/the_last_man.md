IN MEMORY OF NIKRAT KALPAN
THE LAST MAN TO HAVE DIED HONOURABLY
HE WHOSE HEART BEAT LOUDEST IN DEATH

this statue commemorates Kalpan's death at the Battle of Humsat. the battle occurred at a transitory period in the 18th century, just before archers and swordsmen in armies were replaced with riflemen and artillery. while statues in public spaces or intersections portray him charging on a horse, the one in this museum shows him skewered with numerous arrows and is considered more accurate to the myth. pragmatically speaking we believe that the story of his death was exaggerated if not entirely fabricated, but the mythology around it carries a lot of weight for the locals in this part of the country.

Kalpan entered the Battle of Humsat a hopeless man. he knew he was largely outnumbered, and unable to turn to stealth or deception on a March evening as gentle as this one. the sky was clear, flowers blossomed over the plains, too innocent to conceal any stratagem for him. while his peers acquiesced or surrendered to the colonial threat, Kalpan preferred an glorious death to a traitor's shame. he charged into the field on horseback, outnumbered ten to one. a volley of arrows was shot his way, and many pierced through him. 

according to the myth, Kalpan was blessed by a deity (which deity this is varies across regional interpretations) to be unkillable by arrows. little else can explain how he would have survived the barrage penetrating his skin. while this detail was lost over the centuries in this sculpture, Kalpan's horse was portrayed covered in red, showing the blood of both the man and his horse. he screamed in pain and agony as he rode his horse to the enemy frontline, spear in hand. the man who should have been dead many minutes ago had slaughtered a hundred enemy soldiers. he fought valiantly to his last breath. at the end, he was knocked of his horse and impaled with a spear through his chest. as the spearhead protruded through his back it pulled out his heart through it. 

it is said that even as his arms and legs fell limp, Kalpan's heart was heard beating over the entire battlefield. for the next minute everyone froze in horror at the sound. it was louder than the slashing of swords, the galloping of horses. bowstrings were held taut, each sound drowned out by the beating of a noble warrior's heart. and as they heard its deafening beat, they heard it stop with a deafening silence. Kalpan's small platoon subsequently surrendered, and every soldier either fled the battle or died trying.

you are a young man, a son of a young land. a man who we wish to be remembered in legend. should you accept our offer, you will be remembered as a hero for bringing in economic prosperity to your province. i hope you will be more cooperative than your father has been. the plains of Humsat are beautiful, and they deserve more care than the gormless forests of the Rinar ever ravaged by warring barbarians.

i suppose it's your first time hearing the piano Kalpan? no wonder you find it so different a sound from the flutes and trumpets you're used to. Donna has been learning the piano for a few years now. it's one of the many things required of a graceful young lady. she has a great ear for picking up notes but her sense of rhythm is quite lacking. Donna, could you try that again without the metronome?

ah, she's getting better, but she can only hold onto meter for so long. girls need a guide to stay in place. they sound almost perfect at the start, but slowly they stray away from the composition. one must then stand at their ear to correct them, silently yet firmly. with practice and ample repetition, the uniform ticking is instilled in their head even when the guide itself is absent. without this training, as is the case for the novices on the street you might mistake for a musician, the harmony frays and turns discordant. 

it's exceedingly beautiful outside today now that the clouds have cleared. one day these lush red gardens will be the beating heart of the Empire of India. in these very marble walls indeed. but come now Donna, we'll have tea. dusk is near.

but my Kalpan is a different one. many plays have been written about the valorous Kalpan, the mighty Kalpan. but mine is a tragic hero. uhm, you could say that Kalpan has always been tragic, but mine is more of a tragic romantic hero. i hope that doesn't sound too offensive. i know he's a famous figure but it's not like he's a _God_. but that shouldn't matter, because my Kalpan isn't real. he's entirely a fictitious character, it says that in the disclaimer at the start. 

in short, my Kalpan is a heartbroken man with a death wish. he loved a woman dearly. before he came of age, he met the young Donna at the chancellor's house. he heard her soulful playing and fell hopelessly in love with her. but he never spoke a word of it to anyone. he planned to woo her after he expedited negotiations with the empire. years later, during these negotiations, he found out that Donna had been married off to another European years ago. enraged, he decided to wage a war against the empire.

he amassed the few troops who would join him. join him on this, honestly it's, really just a murder-suicide mission. i haven't fleshed out the whole story yet, but i want to add some sort of a symbol to indicate a broken heart. a man with a broken heart, a lovesick man, a world-weary man. but he hides it well, so no one can tell what the deal is. but in the actual battle, he just wanted to get killed in a cool way. so he ran into the enemy frontline recklessly. in his carelessness he got knocked off his horse and impaled immediately. i think i should have him be impaled through the heart, to show that his heart is broken.

i've been too busy with other work to flesh out this story completely. but i wanted to add some other reinforcing symbols from the field of Humsat. something like red roses might go well with red blood. of course the heart is red too, and we could have the roses break in some way to show that his heart is broken. yes this is just a draft, the final screenplay should be much better.

the young man came to my door last evening. he had a solemn expression on his face. i feared he was here to rob me, but he was not. he asked me calmly and politely to let him in. he pulled a copy of my book out of his backpack, and read out the section where Kalpan undertook his final resolve. i was glad that he enjoyed my work.

he told me he had applied to work in the military. and when he went to the camp he was shocked. it was filled with old, fat, short men yelling at young soldiers. he was taught about the utility of stealth, which he found to be a shameful tactic. he learnt that his pay and role were diminutive compared to his colleagues who operated missiles and drones in concealed bunkers. some of these rats were even women. he started reading the news and was dismayed further. none of these men died fighting. many never even saw the battlefield, and those who were granted death were lost to mortar and drone strikes.

he read my book, and he agreed with me. war has become cowardice. he saw my vision. a battle with guns and bombs is far less glorious than wars fought with sword and shield. the soldier needs to be trained, strong, and can only attack off the strength of his own body. he trained himself in swordfighting and other martial arts. he established in himself the image of Kalpan. a man who would not settle to die a peaceful death in old age. a man who wished for his final heartbeat to be his loudest. a man at the center of exodus and genesis. a true red-hearted youth. one who did not play fiddle to the tyrant's tune. 

the young man then pulled a sword out of his backpack and handed it to me. he said that he had built it himself. i was impressed and proud at first, but then i looked at the sword more carefully. it was far too thin to be useful. it looked like it would bend when under even a bit of force. there was no taper, and the blade was shabbily melded to the handle. the handle was made of rough wood, with no guard or pommel to secure the hands and no grip. it was coarse to the touch. i looked at the young man's hands and noticed that his skin was peeling off from his palms.

but the next part terrified me. he asked me to deliver him with the fate of Kalpan. he wished to die by my hands, and to have his corpse left on a flower field. i asked him to think about his wife, children, or any other family members he might have. he replied that he was heartbroken, hopeless like my Kalpan. he had abandoned his family after realising how worthless they were, that they were one of the herd. he plead to me once again for deliverance. i was worried that he would attack me if i denied his request. 

i agreed. i held the sword with both hands in an awkward grip. i could barely grip it in place, and it weighed down my arms. i didn't know what i was to do. my back hurt as i tried not to buckle under the weight of the sword. i felt it strain the muscles in my arms. i tried my best to keep a calm face. the young man was stoic, and had already accepted and planned this fate. i think he had had this conversation many times in his head. i did not have the strength to swing the sword, so i ran into him as hard as i could.

i felt the sword cut through flesh, like a knife through raw meat. the man squealed. blood spilled from his chest and soaked his clothes. then he yelled. i couldn't hear anything but his screaming. he looked down at the sword. we both came to a grim realisation. the sword was lodged into bone. i knew i didn't have the strength to pull it out. i let go of the sword, and he collapsed to the floor with it. my ears were ringing. i lost my balance in horror. i couldn't hear any sound. i found in him a fake Kalpan, and advise my readers to stray away from such fake Kalpans.

Kalpan is a symbol of the decadent past of our country. he was a close-minded, cowardly, and shallow thinker, far exceeded in statecraft by the many people who would come before and after him. he represents a regressive time, and the statue built on him is an active promotion of toxic masculine values. his kingdom housed people of all faiths and languages, he was a problematic multiculturalist with no respect for the stability of the country or ease of communication. he represents a savagery that is incommensurate with the rhythm of the communal will.

by the time you read this message, we have already destroyed the statue of Kalpan. in fact we consider all statues to be tools of idolatry and irrational worship, and will plan to destroy more of them in the future. the replacement of religious figures with statues of mere humans is a leading cause of the dilution of our faith, and action must be taken for the preservation of our peoples. the myth of his postmortem beating heart is pure speculation, further evidence of an unscientific attitude in folk mythology. on a side note, it is a misnomer to refer to Kalpan as the "exodus of genesis". there is no exodus of genesis. it should be referred to as the genesis of exodus, which is more grammatically accurate.

you're absolutely right! as you said, it's hard to believe that the author stopped writing about the legend of Kalpan. as you specified -- he is an enigma, a 'heartthrob', a cross-generational symbol. indeed, a genre defining piece like that demands a sequel or two. one-off freak accident should not stop an author from pursuing the extended myth of the exodus of genesis himself. if i were in his position, i would have spent more time developing the romance of Kalpan. it is implied that he is a tragic hero, a tragic romantic hero with a legendary death. but the romance is hardly present in this story. he is not just a statue in a museum, but the inspiration that fuels the red hearts of many youths to beat for love as his own did.

i also concur that it is strange that a statue could bleed. i understand that its demolition is meant to be pitiful and tragic, but the writer ruins what little immersion they had at that part. i suppose it might rend some emotions in the 
"sensitive young men" who are the target audience of this story, but it fails to make its mark on a more seasoned critic like me. i have no idea how anyone would believe that a statue made of marble or concrete would house in it flesh and a beating heart. it works well to the theme of the story, something about the hubris of the scientific man, but struggles to fit within realistic scientific constraints. one would very much have been able to hear a beating heart inside a statue, and if it ever cracked from the weather and elements it would have made a mess and destroyed everything. it would probably also have a smell. besides this fact, i think it's a pretty decent story.
