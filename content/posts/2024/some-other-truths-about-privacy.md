there are some basic, widely-accepted truths about privacy. more privacy is always good. we want apps to respect our privacy. we do not want apps to collect unnecessary information. apps should only collect information with the consent of the end user. apps that collect unnecessary information do so to spy on us. spying provides material benefit to the company. information has value because it can be sold for money, to advertising networks or data brokers.

these statements are true, at least to a degree. but they hide nuance about what happens in the industry. here are some other statements that are true:

* every website you visit and app you use knows where you live (or at least, how to reach you indirectly)
* there are at least N sites that track every click you perform on their site
* Meta and Google do not sell your data to anyone

some of these may or may not contradict with your existing assumptions. these statements are very well true, but their truth is contingent upon some technicalities.

every website you visit tracks your IP address. they may not store it, but are at least aware of it temporarily. this is necessary because the website servers have to send information back to you somehow. often, they'll even store more data about you, maybe your device or last login time. maintaining user login sessions itself involves a degree of tracking (which is why login systems break when you disable all cookies, and consequently why websites ask for "necessary" cookies)

i can't talk about the commonality of click-tracking in the software industry, but it is at least done in some places. aggressive analytics is the norm, but it has little to do with spying in the general sense. analytics data can be used to detect bugs or UI inconveniences. more often than not, it's going into someone's KPI improvement in a PowerBI graph that doesn't signify anything at all, but is nevertheless an essential part of the software development industry.

companies like Meta don't sell your data (or well, might not! they say that they don't, but who knows?), because they don't need to. they have their own advertising networks (and boy does Meta track aggressively for its ads), and they get to inflate revenue in their Ad agency through tracking data from other orgs. this isn't "selling your data", but is it any better?
