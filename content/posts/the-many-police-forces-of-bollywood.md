what is the role that a fictional police plays in media? almost every social commentary film in bollywood involves some sort of run-ins with the police. at one level, it just represents the police as they exist. the social relevance of a law-enforcing organisation is trivial. if you must comment on the state of the law, including its enforcers is an obvious way to do it. 

the predominant writing of the police in non-social-commentary films is a force that opposes the progress or well-being of the protagonists in some way, but is neither explicitly good nor evil. they may be vaguely corrupt so as to stall the plot, but nothing that comes under the lens of judgement. Khosla ka Ghosla and PK had the examples I had in mind. coincidentally, there is an official [PK game](https://www.firstpost.com/bollywood/after-happy-new-year-aamir-and-anushka-launch-mobile-game-for-pk-1848181.html) that involves running away from a cop. 

films centered on the police themselves are more pointed, in either praise or contempt. A Wednesday showcases a police official as the protagonist. while the film as a whole questions the actions of the police, it still presents them in a positive light. this is an involved, actively concerned, and benevolent police force trying its best to prevent a terrorist attack. this is a pattern that would carry on to future Neeraj Pandey films. on the opposite side, Anurag Kashyap's Ugly shows the police as an antagonistic force. policemen actively hinder the progress of the protagonist in finding his daughter, and only beats up the men when they're down.

Dombivali Fast has a police that is sympathetic, but still condemned to arrest local do-gooder by their seniors. Pink's police is little more than a tool for the propagation of corruption. there are many permutations and combinations in which the police is presented throughout bollywood. 

the police, symbolically, represents agents of the status quo morality. the relation of the police to the characters of the film show the moral tensions that exist between the film's characters and this status quo morality. in Ugly and Pink, officers ask meaningless questions to the great distress of the protagonists. A Wednesday shows the police struggle with the actions and thoughts of a terrorist-terroriser, mirroring our own perplexity at his moral positions. 

the police also serve a different role symbolically from the military and the law. these two are far less likely to be the object of attention than the police. the military is often valourised, and there's a plethora of Salman-Khan-adjacent military / special forces films. while the moral positions of the military are contrasted against other governments, terrorists, or insurgents; the police is placed against more domestic agents.

the law connects morality to truth. the drama of a legal drama is often fact-finding and fact-hiding, and those are what prove which party is good and which is evil. in that angle, the police can be seen as a connection between morality and power. while legal enforcement is methodical and orderly, police enforcement is depicted as violent and often chaotic.
