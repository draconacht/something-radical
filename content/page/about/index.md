### what is something radical?

it's a blog where i write about stuff that i want to write about.

### where did the blog name come from?

yes it's an Utena reference. maybe i'll write about it someday.

### what is a macro-microblog?

whatever goes here i would probably post on twitter. but here i don't have to think about character limits or the like. plus i get to have my own aesthetic which is cool.

### why not just post on twitter?

i also post on twitter. this format just lets me write in a richer text format, and store and categorise my thoughts more effectively.

### why did you choose these colours in particular?

plain dark mode is too uninspired. 

### why did you use Hugo with a pre-established theme instead of making your own blog from scratch?

i like the idea of making my own blog from scratch, but i don't / can't do front-end dev. if i ever make a blog, i want it to be responsively designed, and that's going to take time. i find this to be a good enough compromise.

### why the lower case?

i hate capitalism.

### why did you swap your escape and caps lock keys?

glad you asked.

### you sound really pretentious.

thanks.
